## Origin
Aidoc was founded in 2016 by a team of 4 former IDF [Talpiot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program) intelligence officers. [1, 8] Talpiot is a highly exclusive intelligence program within the IDF, attracting thousands of applicants every year, yet only 20-50 are chosen to participate. Upon his release from the 10 year minimum service in the Talpiot program, Elad Walach, now CEO, founded the radiology AI startup that would become the global radiology sensation "Aidoc". [6] Aidoc was founded with the focus of aiding radiologists in reducing turnaround time, and increasing efficiency for detection of acute anomalies [8]. Since it's launch in 2016, Aidoc has went through [5 rounds of funding, amassing a total of $263.6 million in funding through venture capitalists](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/aidoc-medical/financials). [7] 

## How?
Aidoc's AI based decision support software uses artificial intelligence and image recognition tools to detect internal injuries on CT scans. The software is described as "Always on", as it reads the CT scans in real time, rapidly notifying Radiologist of life threatening detections so that they can be prioritized. This early onset detection can be lifesaving due to the algorithm flagging the life threatening anomalies so that Radiologists can quickly make the diagnosis so that the time critical cases can be treated ahead of those with more minor, non-life threatening conditions. [9]

## Why choose Aidoc?
Aidoc operates in the growing field of artificial intelligence within healthcare, specializing in medical imagery. This sector primarily involves the use of computer vision and artificial intelligence to rapidly detect time sensitive anomalies and then sort these findings higher in the radiologists list of cases to read so that they may be diagnosed quicker. However, in the AI based healthcare solutions market, Aidoc does not stand alone. There exists multiple competitors trying to take the AI driven CT anomaly detection crown from Aidoc. One of these competitors, "[GLEAMER](https://www.gleamer.ai/)", has recently gained popularity due to its "[ChestView](https://www.gleamer.ai/solutions/chestview/)" AI. The ChestView AI works very similarly to Aidoc; utilizing image recognition tools and artificial intelligence but instead of detecting brain life threatening anomalies, ChestView detects findings that are likely to be lung cancer. With two massive companies each controlling technology that detects life threatening irregularities, it is safe to say that they will compete with each other at the expense of doctors and patients. The interesting thing however, is that instead of these two innovative companies causing a divide of technology in radiology, they decided to partner with each other. Due to this partnership, the ChestView AI is now run under Aidoc's aiOS platform, solidifying Aidoc as the exclusive platform provider for both brain and chest imaging AI detection. This partnership underscores Aidoc's potential to continue to flourish in the evolving world of artificial intelligence. By embracing collaboration over competition, Aidoc has set their sights far into the future. 
> “This extended partnership with Aidoc is another major step in our collaboration started in 2021 showing the success of the partnership and trust built between our teams,” says Christian Allouche, CEO & Co-Founder of GLEAMER. “We are thrilled to extend the GLEAMER portfolio accessible to our joint customers to improve patient care and elevate radiologists and physicians to augmented radiology reading.” [10] [10]

## Results
My father ([James Sancrant](https://www.triadradiology.com/radiologist/sancrant-james/)), a practicing radiologist, has observed firsthand the transformative impact of Aidoc's technology in the field of emergency medicine. He notes that Aidoc's advanced AI-driven diagnostics have been instrumental in identifying critical conditions, such as undetected strokes, in patients at hospitals with limited resources. This early detection capability has allowed for timely interventions, including the rapid transfer of patients to specialized treatment centers. According to his experiences, Aidoc's solutions have significantly reduced treatment delays, potentially saving countless lives by ensuring patients receive the necessary care promptly. It is without a doubt that Aidoc's technology is saving countless lives around the planet, but lets dive into how they compare to other AI-based algorithms for identifying intercranial hemorrhages in CT scans. [A study published by Aidoc was conducted and then presented in September 2023 displaying this data.](https://www.aidoc.com/blog/imaging-ai-comparative-study/) This study shows that when compared against each other, Aidoc's ICH algorithm consistently outperforms Vendor A and B in both sensitivity by 29% and accuracy by 17.5%. The study also shows that when used alongside a primary radiologist's review, Aidoc's solution further enhances the sensitivity of detecting ICH (from 86.4% to 96%) and when used in conjunction with double radiology review, reaches up to 98.9% sensitivity. This data shows that Aidoc's solution can nearly match the heightened accuracy of having two radiologists review a case, potentially reducing the need for second opinions and speeding up the diagnostic process. [11]

In Summary, the unfair advantage utilized by Aidoc is its proprietary AI operation system, aiOS, which when partnered with its robust machine learning models, delivers superior performance over its competitors. 

## Going forward
It is no telling that Aidoc has solidified itself as a superpower in the artificial intelligence CT anomaly detection market, but the exciting aspect is their potential for growth. With the emergence of commercially available mixed reality headsets, one potential area for growth may somehow seem more science fiction than AI in radiology. Radiologists setups cost [tens of thousands of dollars due to the requirement for large, high resolution monitors](https://www.monitors.com/collections/best-sellers) coupled with the need for significant computational power to display the images. These setup make it so that radiologists must be at their workstation in order to make even the most urgent diagnosis. However, their computers have recently been down-scaled into cloud based systems that are powered by a central processing unit that projects these images to the radiologists monitors through the cloud. While this solves one issue, the constraint is now the monitors; This is where mixed reality headsets come into play. By utilizing mixed reality headsets, radiologists could have their workstation go from a costly setup that is practically immobile to a mixed reality headset that they could have on them at all times. Complimented by Aidoc's rapid detection technology, radiologists could make diagnosis on the go, whenever and wherever, further decreasing the time it takes to go from CT scan to diagnosis. By exploring the field of mixed reality, Aidoc could not only further solidify themselves as leaders in healthcare technology, but save countless more lives while at it.
